SYNOPSIS
	Unit Test classes for SuperCollider

DESCRIPTION

	Usage:

		Tests are implemented as subclasses of class Test typically named with suffix "Tests" such as "JSONTests".

		TestRunner.postAllTestClasses
		TestRunner.runAllTestsInAllTestClasses
		TestRunner.postAllTestClassesWithPrefix("Test")
		TestRunner.runAllTestsInTestClassesWithPrefix("Test")

EXAMPLES

REQUIREMENTS
	These classes were developed and have been tested in SuperCollider 3.6.6.

INSTALLATION
	Copy the Test-sc folder to the user-specific or system-wide extension directory. Recompile the SuperCollider class library.

	The user-specific extension directory may be retrieved by evaluating Platform.userExtensionDir in SuperCollider, the system-wide by evaluating Platform.systemExtensionDir.
